# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
"Guess the Number Game" is a simple, interactive Python console game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Each incorrect guess provides a hint to help the player zero in on the right number, making the game both engaging and mildly educational.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players interact with the game via the console, entering guesses and receiving immediate feedback.
- **Hint System**: Hints are provided to guide players after every two incorrect guesses.
- **Performance Tracking**: The game tracks the number of attempts a player makes to guess the correct number and congratulates them upon success.

## How to Run
To play the "Guess the Number Game", you will need Python installed on your computer. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the script as mentioned above. The game will automatically generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you to make a guess.
2. **Enter Your Guess**: Input your guess into the console. The game will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
3. **Receive Hints**: Every two incorrect guesses, you'll receive a hint about the number's properties (e.g., even/odd, multiple of 5, etc.).
4. **Winning the Game**: Continue guessing until you find the right number. The game will then tell you how many attempts it took you to guess correctly.

## Development
This game is a great starter project for those looking to improve their Python skills. It involves basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation.
